#Redirector

Redirector is a small smtp server for convert mail that send to them to other service e.g. http. My goal is send email to my email address and convert that mail to blog post by request to another service which I'm working on it too.

To use this, have to setup dns pointing sub-domain to server that run this project and configure this service via web, default username and password is `admin` and `password`.
